For Feature F1-2 Authentication with Cognito, implement the UI and routing for /login and protected routes.

Follow Base UI contract: mobile-first, calm/professional, progressive disclosure, and clear disclaimers.

Phase 1 requires Login & Plan Selection at /login. 

prd.phase-1

Implement Cognito Hosted UI flow (recommended for speed): /login shows buttons that redirect to Cognito Hosted UI; handle callback; store tokens/session; then route to /dashboard.

/login page must include plan cards (Free vs Paid) and require selection before enabling “Continue”.

Add loading/error states and clean redirect logic (unauthenticated → /login; authenticated → /dashboard).

Update docs/feature-index.md and feature docs (spec/tasks/tests/acceptance/rollback). Add tests mocking Cognito verifier per Base mocking policy.

After implementation, set status to In Review and provide how to verify locally.
